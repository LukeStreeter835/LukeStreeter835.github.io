        <img src="pexels-emre-can-acer-2079438" title="Our Coffe Shop">
        <p>We are twin brothers who were born at Sweden. We would move to Chicago when we were both 18 and we would begin our bisness Tea Cup Troble. It was our first small bisnuess as a small tea shop with a 1000 copies of Catan. We would eventually close up that bisnuess to open Brewed Awakening as a small coffe shop. With our appreciation of good coffe, we hope to provide the best coffe no matter the price.</p>

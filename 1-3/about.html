        <p>We are twin brothers who were born in Sweden. We would move to Chicago when we were both 18 and we would begin our business TeaCup Trouble. It was our first small business as a small tea shop with 1000 copies of Catan and 3 tables. We would eventually close up that business to open Brewed Awakening as a small coffee shop. With our appreciation of good coffee, we hope to provide the best coffee no matter the price.</p>
